# Meningoccoccal infections

This topic is about only Neisseria meningitidis, which is the cause of meningoccoccal infections. In 98% cases meningoccoccal infection manifest as nasopharyngeal infection. Only in 2% cases Neisseria meningitidis can cause Meningitis, as well as other pathogens (enteroviruses, as Group B streptococcus, streptococcus pneumoniae, etc). In theory any infection which passes through hematoencephalic barrier can cause meningitis.

- **Pathogen**: Neisseria meningitidis, bean-shaped diplococci
- **Transmission**: airborne droplet (воздушно-капельно)
- Pathogen **noticeable** on the smear of meningitis patients in the cytoplasm of the cell.
- **Seasonality**: Winter mostly, because of closed rooms without ventilation.
- **Subtypes**
	- If nasopharynx is healthy
		- 98% percent of infected patients gonna sick only with nasopharyngitis.
	- elif: patient have tonsillitis or pharyngitis
		- Generalization of infection.
- **Clinical features**
	- Neonates
		- Early symptoms
			- Lethargy
			- Muscle hypotonia
			- Irritability
			- Poor appetite, vomiting
			- Dyspnea
		- Late symptoms
			- Fontanelle bulging
			- High-pitched crying
			- Seizures
	- Children-adults
		- Fever
		- Headache
		- Neck stiffness
		- Photophobia
		- Malaise
		- Seizures
- **Complications**
	- Waterhouse-Frideriksen Syndrome - necrosis of the adrenal gland


# Nasopharyngitis
- **Clinical features**
	- Flu-like intoxication
	- Some catarrhal symptoms
- **Diagnosis**
	- Nasopharynx swab
	- ELISA
	- Leukocytosis
- **Differential diagnosis**
	- In case of Influenza there will be leukocytopenia.
- **Treatment**
	- Penicillins (Dose: 1 milliion 6 times)

# Meningitis disease
- **Main symptoms**
	- Temperature
	- Vomiting without relief
	- Headache (severe)
	- Hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity)
	- Hemorrhagic rash, star-like (first at legs & butts and goes upper)
		- Star rashes - meningoccoccemia
	- Meningeal pose ("Поза легавой собаки")
- **Pre-hospital help** (*child*)
	- Prednisolone 2-3mg/kg
		- *Decreases permeability of vessels*
	- Levomycetine succinate (Chloramphenicol) 25mg/kg
- **Diagnosis**
	- **CSF puncture** - on the level of 4-5th lumbar vertebrae
		- Pleocytosis 
			- ↑ granulocytes (if >50% means purulent CSF)
		- Glucose
			- Normally half as in blood
		- Protein ↑
		- Lactate ↑↑
- **Treatment at 1st-2nd-3rd day:**
	- Prednisolone 2-3 mg/kg
	- Levomycetine succinate 8-9mg/kg
	- *if no rashes:*
		- cephalosporins of broad action



- **CSF normals**
	- Normally only lymphocytes < 5
	-
