Try to explain, what you learnt. 
This practice helps to crystalize your knowledge, polish it more.

## The Feynman technique
1. Pretend to teach a concept you want to learn about to a student in the sixth grade.
2. Identify gaps in your explanation. Go back to the source material to better understand it.
3. Organize and simplify.
4. Transmit (optional).
