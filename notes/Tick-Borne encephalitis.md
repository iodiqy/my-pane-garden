# Tick-borne encephalitis lecture notes

- Flavivirus
- Mechanism of transmission: transmissive
- Vector: Ticks (transovarial transmission)
- Violation of gray matter of brain
- **Неочаговые**
	- Лихорадочная
	- Менингеальная
		- Severe headache
		- Vomiting without feeling better
			- Inflammation of meninges causes violation of CSF flow, which affects to nausea center in medulla.
		- Hyperesthesia - extreme sensitivity (e.g. to light)
- **Очаговая**
	- Менингоэнцефалитическую
	- Полимиелитическая
	- Пол и радикулоневритическую
- Least indications for lumbar punction (even without meningeal signs)
	- Fever 
	- Severe headache
	- Vomiting without relief ("мозговая рвота")
- **Diagnosis**
	- Not earlier than 3-5 day - ELISA test
	- Leukopenia
	- Lymphocytosis
	- ~ ESR↑ (not much immune proteins produced)
	- Glucose normal (meningococcus, tuberculosis bacterias eat glucose, which causes hypoglycemia)
	- CSF
		- Glucose in CSF should be as half as in blood (e.g. blood 3 mmol/ in CSF 1.5 mmol)
		- Pleocytosis (normally should see only lymphocytes < 10)
			- if leukocytosis: purulent meningitis
			- lymphocytosis: viral meningitis
- Treatment
	- Hospitalization
	- Riboverin
	- Immunoglobulin
	- Osmodiuretics: mannitol (see [[Diuretics]])
		- Increase osmotic pressure in periphery blood, which lowers volume of CSF
- Prevention
	- Vaccination: every year


> [!tip] **Encephalitis**: seizures, coma, sopor, ptosis, paresis, paralysis

>[!tip] Poliomyelitic: Paralysis

>[!tip] Полиорадиконеврит: Pains in extremities, as in neuralgia
