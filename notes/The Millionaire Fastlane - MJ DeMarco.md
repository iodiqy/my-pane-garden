# Consumer → Producer
*Switch from being consumer to being a producer.*
- Think about how businesses around us actually works (marketing stuff, selling stuff, what techniques they use)
- For example: in the Samsung store you not just looking for a phones as a consumer, but think about how their marketing works or how amazing are their selling tables.

# Commitment vs Interest
*Show commitment rather than interest.*
- You have to do things that other people are not willing to do or not able to do. This shows commitment.

*Quote from the book:*
> Interest works on your business an hour a day. 
> Commitment works on your business seven days a week whenever time permits.

It's hard to build a successfull business. Hard work does not have to be suffering, it's hard, but it doesn't have to be painful. *It can be fun.*

>[!tip] You do have to start being committed to the stuff you're doing, rather than just interested in it.

# Commandments (Заповеди)
*5 commandments you should to follow:*
- **Commandment of need**
	- 90% of businesses fail within the first five years, because they don't satisfy the commandment need. 
	- It's hard to make a business which tries to solve the problem that people don't actually have.
- **Commandment of entry**
	- Try to build a business in a zone where the barrier for entry is high rather than low. 
	- This will make hard to copy your business.
	- For example: It's hard to start second Amazon, because entry barrier is really high.
- **Commandment of control**
	- Have a business which one you can control.
	- For example: YouTube channel business lives on the YouTube platform and depends on it.
	- Other example: If you are selling someone's product, you depend on that stuff.
- **Commandment of scale**
