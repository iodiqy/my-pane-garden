# Overview
- Endotoxin is very toxic, delays everything in organism (e.g. bone marrow function ↓)
- Recover very long duration (even up to 2 years)
- if Persistent fever more than 5 days without other reason, need to do hemoculture analysis.

# Lecture notes
- **Pathogen**
	- Gram negative rod Salmonella typhi
- **Transmission**
	- Fecal-oral transmission
	- Anthroponotic
- **Clinical features**
	- Persistent fever 
	- Bradycardia
	- Delayed patient response
	- Endotoxin causes shock → lowered BP → Oligoanuria (↓urine output)
	- *Mostly constipation common, rather than diarrhea as in Salmonellosis*
- **Laboratory**
	- Leukopenia (because of endotoxin, which delays bone marrow function)
		- Absolute eosinophilia
		- Relative lymphocytosis
	- Toxic Epithelial cells, Cylinders, Proteins in urine
- **Diagnostics**
	- Blood - bacteriological examination
	- Urine
	- Feces
	- Serology (Widal test)
- **Treatment**
	- Mandatory hospitalization
	- Bed routine (because ulcer bleeding risk)
	- Diet number 4 (soft meal)
	- **Antibiotics**
		- Fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin) 
			- Because can enter inside cells
		- Levomycetin succinate
	- **↓Permeability**
		- Permeability of vessels wall are increased → fluid goes into intestitial compartment → less circulating blood volume (ОЦК) → thick blood → hypoxia → thrombosis → DIC syndrome.
		- Glucocorticosteroids → ↓permeability of blood vessels
		- Colloid solutions to restore water in blood
	- **Cold diet**
		- Cold water on belly
		- Cold meal
	- Aminocaproic acid - antifibrinolytic agent

>[!tip] Negative 3 feces and 1 bile test required to discharge the patient. (with 5 day interval)

# Flashcards

Why there is a leukopenia in a Typhoid fever, however it's a bacteriological disease which should cause leukocytosis? #card 
Because of endotoxin, which is very toxic and cause decrease in bone marrow function.

Why Fluoroquinolones are chosen for treatment of Typhoid fever? #card 
Typhoid pathogen located inside of the cell and fluoroquinolones are able to enter inside of cells.
