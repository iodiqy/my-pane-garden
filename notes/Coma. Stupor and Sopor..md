## General data
- **Coma** (from the Greek komas, or deep sleep) is a state of unresponsiveness in which the patient is incapable of arousing to external or internal stimuli (lack of alertness). The degree of coma can vary from lighter stages (also denoted as semicoma) with observed changes in autonomic function or brief moaning to strong stimulation, to the deepest stage with absence of any brain stem responses (eg, pupillary and corneal reflexes), cyclic autonomic activity, and motor tone.
- A **stuporous** patient appears asleep and requires repeated, stronger stimuli to arouse, yet may not achieve full state of arousal and quickly drifts back to persistent inactivity when the stimulus is withdrawn. When aroused, this patient may or may not open their eyes and partially respond to requests. At times, restlessness and motor stereotypes are observed. Sopor, the Latin word for deep sleep and a term used in some European countries, denotes an intermediate state between stupor and coma.
	- Diffucult to rouse a person
- **Sopor**: abnormally deep sleep, an unusually profound sleep. Patients open eyes in response to pain, sound and other stimuli. 
- A **vegetative state** can follow coma and identifies a state in which the brainstem and diencephalic (thalamic) activity is present to a degree that clinical signs of spontaneous arousal are observed; however, clinical evidence of awareness of self and environment is lacking. The patients often show blink responses to light; intermittent eye movements (sometimes erroneously interpreted as following objects or looking at family members); stimulus-sensitive automatisms such as swallowing, bruxism, and moaning, as well as primitive motor responses and cycles of sleeping and waking.
	- If this state lasts longer than 30 days, it is referred to as *persistent vegetative state (PVS)* and is used as a descriptive clinical syndrome rather than a disease-specific entity. The most common causes include cardiac arrest, head trauma, severe brain infections, and various causes of thalamic necrosis. Vegetative states can also be seen in the terminal phase of degenerative illnesses such as Alzheimer disease. Ambiguous terms for PVS such as apallic syndrome and neocortical death should be avoided.

## Classification
#### According to the Etiology
1. **Primary, or intracranial:** traumatic, vascular, infectious, neoplasms of the brain, epileptic, metabolic and hypoxic.
2. **Secondary, or extracranial:** severe trauma of head.
#### According to the severity of the coma
1. **Moderate coma**
	- Has reaction to pain stimuli
		- Flexion and extensor responce may appear to pain stimuli
	- Closed eyes
	- Pupillary and corneal reflexes are usually preserved.
		- Abdominal reflexes are ↓ and tendon reflexes are variable.
2. **Deep coma**
	- Absence of any reactions to any external stimuli
		- ↓ or absence of reflexes without bilateral mydriasis
	- Violation of spontaneous respiration and cardiovascular activity
3. **Terminal coma**
	- Bilateral fixed mydriasis
	- Diffuse muscle atony
	- Rhythm and respiratory rate disorders
	- Apnea
	- Severe tachycardia
	- Blood pressure is critical or not detected

## Pathophysiology
1. Intracranial processes with damage to the brain tissue (hematoma, abscess, tumor, epilepsy)
2. Infectious lesions of the central nervous system (meningitis, encephalitis)
3. Toxic damage to the brain (poisoning by alcohol, mushrooms, drugs)
4. Failure of cerebral blood flow (consequences of asystole, Adam-Stokes attacks)
5. Metabolic causes (impaired water and electrolytes balance, carbohydrate metabolism, acid-base balance, renal and hepatic insufficiency)
6. Disorder of temperature balance (sunstroke, hypothermia)
7. Endocrine diseases (Diabetic, hypocorticoid, hypothyroid, hypopituitary coma)
## ↑ Intracranial pressure (ICP)
- **Decreasing of the intracranial pressure.** An increase in ICP is an urgent clinical situation that requires the implementation of appropriate measures aimed at its reduction, which avoids secondary damage to the brain due to compression of its tissues or a decrease in cerebral blood flow. Carrying out the above diagnostic measures makes it possible to establish the causes of an increase in ICP, and, accordingly, the key measures are those aimed at its elimination (surgical and conservative treatment). Hyperventilation providing a pCO2 level of 25-30 mmHg. Art. (levels less than 25 mm Hg can cause a significant decrease in cerebral blood flow, leading to cerebral ischemia). Restriction of fluid intake. Avoid solutions containing free water (5% glucose). Isotonic NaCl solution, necessary to maintain blood osmolarity, must be administered at half the dose.

## CSF pressure [4]
==Cerebrospinal fluid== is a liquid biological environment of the body that circulates in the ventricles of the brain, subarachnoid space of the brain and spinal cord.
- Amount of CSF in ventricles and subarachnoid space of the brain of an adult is 130-150 ml.
- 400-500 ml of cerebrospinal fluid is produced daily.
- CSF normally when:
	- Lying down: 70-120 mm Hg
	- Standing (sitting): 140-180 mm Hg
### Cytosis (Pleocytosis)
*Increase in the number of cells in the CSF.*
- ==Minor pleocytosis== is possible with progressive paralysis, syphilis, specific meningitis, arachnoiditis, encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, tumors, spinal and brain trauma.
- ==Massive pleocytosis== is observed in acute purulent meningitis, abscess.
- ==Lymphocytic pleocytosis== is noted in the postoperative period during neurosurgical operations, chronic inflammation of the meninges (tuberculous meningitis, cysticercosis arachnoiditis).
### Glucose
- **Increases** with encephalitis, tumors, diabetes, sometimes with tetany and tetanus.
- **Sharply decreases** in tuberculous, streptococcal and meningococcal meningitis.
### Chlorides
- **Increase** with brain tumors, abscesses, echinococcus, multiple sclerosis, uremia, nephritis, with progressive paralysis.
- **Reduction** - in tuberculous meningitis.
### Urea
- **Increases** in kidney disease, atherosclerosis. With uremia, the level of urea reaches 9-16 mmol / l. 
- ==In children==, urea rises with acute infections.
