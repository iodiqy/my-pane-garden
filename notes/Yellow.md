	- Melena - black or tarry stool (which is degraded blood)
	- Jaundice
	- Hemorrhage
	- Backache
- **Diagnosis**
	- PCR, ELISA
	- Lab
		- ALT, AST ↑
		- Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia
		- ↑ PTT (partial thromboplastin time)
	- Liver biopsy - may see **Councilman bodies** (eosinophilic apoptotic globules)
- **Vaccine**
