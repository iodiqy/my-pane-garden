Quote from research paper:
>[!tip]  If money doesn't make you happy you're probably not spending it right. [1]

## Spend money on experiences rather than on things
- It combats hedonic adaptation
- Anticipate (предвосхищать)
- No comparison trap. We tend not to compare our holiday.
- We share them with people

## Spend money on friends
- Spending on other people has a bigger return for you than spending on yourself.

## Spend money on health

## Spend money on small things rather than big ones
- This is also combats hedonic adaptation
- Shorter and more quicker vacations than just having a massive blowout once a year for example.

## Delay consumption whenever possible
- Credit cards are evil. Payment by installments (рассрочка)
- Anticipation is free happiness

> People who devote time to anticipating enjoyable experiences report being happier generel.
> Anticipating for a holiday is sometimes more happier than holiday itself.

## Spend money to buy back your time
- Create streams of passive income
- Time is the most valuable things that we have

## Spend money to remove salient negatives
*Salient means major, существенные*
- Removing major negatives are way better than adding extra positives.
- *For example: Spending time on cleaning, instead I will be able to spent that time to have a good time*

## Spend money on things that enable other interesting activities
- Thing about how buying new things can allow me to do smth interesting.
- *For example: Buying a car can give you an ability to take a road trips with friends*
	- This can also combat comparison challenge, you can just use a car to do your activities, not comparising with other cars, because it basically allow you just to do the activity.
- Other example: Buying a kindle forced me to read more book comfortably.

## Spend money on charity
