# Overview
- **Pathogen**: Entamoeba histolytica, a protozoan
- **Transmission**
	- Fecal-oral
		- Amebic cysts are excreted in stool and can contaminate drinking water or food
		- Transmission may also occur through sexual contact
- **Endemic region**: Tropical and subtropical region (e.g. Mexico, Southeast Asia, India)
- **Incubation period**
	- Intestinal amebiasis: 1-4 weeks
	- Extraintestinal amebiasis: a few weeks to several years
- **Diagnostics**
	- *Stool analysis*
		- Microscopic identification of cysts or trophozoites in fresh stool
			- Trophozoites[^1] often contain ingested erythrocytes
				- **E**. histolytica **E**ngulfs **E**rythrocytes (**EEE**)
		- EIA or coproantigen ELISA and PCR
	- *Colonoscopy with biopsy:* flask-shaped ulcers
- **Treatment**
	- Nitroimidazole derivative as *metronidazole* or *tinidazole*
	- Luminal agent (e.g. paromomycin, diloxanide, or iodiquinol)
	- Invasive procedures
		- Aspiration
		- Surgical drainage
- **Complication**
	- Intestinal amebiasis
		- Fulminant or necrotizing colitis
		- Toxic megacolon → colon rupture
		- Ameboma
		- Fistula formation (e.g. rectovaginal)
	- Extraintestinal amebiasis
		- Secondary infection → pyogenic abscess
		- Abscess rupture → peritonitis
		- Dissemination, possibly resulting in a brain abscess
		- Direct extension to the pericardium or pleura

#### Intestinal amebiasis (Amebic dysentery)
- Loose stools with mucus and bright red blood
- Painful defecation, tenesmus, abdominal pain, cramps, weight loss, and anorexia

#### Extraintestinal amebiasis
- Mostly acute onset of symptoms
- 95% of cases: amebic liver abscess, usually a solitary abscess in the right lobe.
