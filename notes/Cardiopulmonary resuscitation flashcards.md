- Danger
- Responce
- Shout for help
- Air way
- Breathing
- Circulation
- Defibrillation

How does hyperventilation (within CPR) affect cardiac output? #card 
Decreases cardiac output.
*Excessive breathing increases intrathoracic pressure, which reduces coronary perfusion because blood can't flow back into heart. (↓ diastole → lower EF[^1])*
^1665936217636

Name the types of cardiac arrest (3): #card 
*By ↓ of prevalence:*
- Fibrillation
- Asystole
- Electromechanical dissociation

Which antibiotics can be used to treat Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection? (at least 2) #card
Vancomycin or daptomycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, linezolid
^1665999292550

**Vancomycin**  is the antibiotic of choice for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). How does vancomycin stop bacterial replication? #card
**It inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis**, which stops growth and replication of bacteria.
This is a mainstay for the treatment of beta-lactam-resistant gram-positive infections.

What is the mortality of septic shock? #card 
around 40%
^1665999292553

Why does DIC syndrome occurs in sepsis? #card
During sepsis, ***inflammation*** diffusely ***activates the coagulation system***, consuming multiple clotting factors, which results in DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation)
^1665999292554

Name **carbapenem**-type antibiotics: (at least two) #card 
imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem, and doripenem - have broad antimicrobial spectrum. 
^1666000732371

For what element in their chemical structure antibiotics are named as beta-lactam? #card 
A beta-lactam ring.

*Image: penicillins structure (beta-lactam ring in red)*
^1666000732376

How does beta-lactam antibiotics achieve bactericidical action? #card 
By inhibition of cell wall synthesis. (precisely: inhibits synthesis of peptidoglycan layer of bacteria)
^1666000732378

What bacteria is the most common cause of sepsis? #card 
Staphylococcus aureus
^1666003605482

What is the early signs of septic shock? (2) #card 
Hypothermia (<36) and Leukopenia
^1666003612824

What solutions for infusion are used for better microcirculation? (at least 2) #card 
Refortan (pentastarch), Rheopolyglukin (dextran), Gelofusin (gelatin)- *(Plasma substitute group drugs)* + blood transfusion: new erythrocytes also for better microcirculation.
