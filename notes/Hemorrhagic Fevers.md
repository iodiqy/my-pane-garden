# Overview

Group of diseases, which are characterized by the regular development of **hemorrhagic syndrome** during the acute fever condition and generalized damage of the microcirculatory vessels with development of thrombohemorrhagic syndrome.

Pathogens of hemorrhagic fevers are:
- Arenaviridae
- Bunuyaviridae
- Filoviridae
- Flavoviridae

*Genome is single-stranded RNA.*

Replication of those viruses often happens in the endothelium cells of microcirculatory vessels, which leads to hemorrhagic syndrome.

## Classification
- Tick-borne
	- [[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF)]] 
- Mosquite 
	- [[Dengue]]
		- nonhemorrhagic
			- can be treated by ribovirin
		- hemorrhagic
			- usually need blood transfusion
		- Differential diagnosis
			- if meningeal syndrome - japanese encephalitis
	- [[Yellow]] - (liver predominantly alt ast yellow hepatomegaly)
- Zoonotic
	- [[Ebola]] - Intoxication syndrome (predominant)

ГЛПС - поражение почек - олигоурия → полиурия
- Mortality 20-30%

# Treatment
- Obligatory hospitalization
- Bed rest till cessation of polyuria
- **Etiotropic**
	- [[Ribavirin]] (nucleoside analogues)
	- Interferons (Viferon, Reaferon)
	- Immunoglobulins
- **Pathogenetic treatment**
	- Detoxification therapy (5-10% glucose, polyionic solutions)
	- Angioprotectors (calcium gluconate)
	- Fresh frozen plasma
	- Thrombo-mass, erythro-mass
	- Inhibitors of proteases
	- Antioxidative therapy (Vitamin E)
