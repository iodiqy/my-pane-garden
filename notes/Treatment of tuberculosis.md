# Lecture notes

- BACTEC method is used to test for drug sensitivity
- Tuberculosis in pregnancy
	- First trimester: should be performed *abortion*

# Treatment of M/XDR-TB
- There is no sense to use more than 4-5 drugs to treat tuberculosis, because this will cause too much side effects.
	- MDR-TB - enough 4 drugs
	- XDR-TB - need 5 drugs
		- Treated during 6-9 months
- 1st group
	- Pirazinamid
		- smell disorder
- Groups of drugs
	- **group A** (most effective drugs)
		- Levofloxacin
			- Causes joint problems
		- Moxifloxacin
			- Cardiotoxic: causes elongation of QT interval
		- Bedacvilin
		- Linazolid
			- Periphery neuropathy
	- **group B**
		- Clofazimin (used to treat [[Leprosy (Hansen's disease)]])
			- Skin hyperpigmentation
		- Cycloserine/Terizidone
	- **group C** (supportive drugs)
		- Ethambutol
			- Optic toxicity: examination of eyes every month
		- Delamanide (has potential to be in higher groups)
			- 200mg/daily
		- Imipeneme


# Side effects
---
#### Cardiotoxicity
- **Cardiotoxic drugs** which causes elongation of QT interval (normally 450ms)
	- Bedacvilin
	- Clofazimin
	- Moxifloxacin
	- Delamanide
	- Levofloxacin
- *Keep in mind cardiotoxicity of drugs that are used to treat other infections within the tuberculosis (e.g. Azithromycin - which is also has cardiotoxic effect)*

#### Periphery polyneuropathy
Multiple damage of periphery nerves.
- Drugs which causes periphery polyneuropathy
	- Linazolid
	- Izoniazid
	- Cycloserine
- Symptoms
	- Numbness on limbs
	- Tactile hypersensitivity
