## Using Bear as a CMS for your digital garden

>I have been piecing together have Andy M has setup the infrastructure for his “evergreen notes” and importing prose-based prompts into Anki. At the crux of it all the writing seems to be Bear, a beautiful Apple specific markdown editor for writing prose. On MacOS, Bear has a powerful hidden feature that lets you access a local SQL database containing all of your notes. From there you are able to generate scripts that can extract all (or a subset) or notes for Bear, parse them for your purpose, and upload them to wherever you need!

## Another variant is uploading content by myself without using CMS, then later on upgrade by own CMS.



## Need a mail newsletter system


## Website should have commenting and Likes system, to stimulate users stay consistent in writing and motivated.
