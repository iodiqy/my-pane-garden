>[!tip] It's more dangerous to be reinfected by brucellosis for person who had brucellosis previously. This reaction can be very dangerous.

>[!tip] Brucella can lead to Euphoric effect. That's why patients don't much feel high temperature.

>[!tip] Usual causes of infertility are 50% brucellosis, 40% Parotitis, 10% STD (Sexually transmitted diseases)

>[!tip] Bacteria persists in organism for 3-5 years

-  Gram negative
-   **Immunity**: only for 3-5 years (and might be reinfection)
-   **Treatment:** Doxycylline

# Lecture notes

- **Pathogen**: Brucella, gram-negative bacteria.
- **Vectors**: cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs.
- **Contamination**:
	- A lot of infection released on birthing (bacteria in amniotic cavity)
- **Incubation**: 1-3 weeks
- **Clinical features:**
	- Flu-like symptoms
	- Night sweats
	- High, potentiaxlly **undulant fever** (rising and falling wave fevers)
	- Painful lymphadenopathy
	- **Course of disease:**
		- **Acute** (till 3 months)
			- Damage to vegetative nervous system
				- Excessive sweating
				- Wet palms
			- Cold extremities
			- Orchiepididymitis - inflammation of testicles
			- Hepatomegaly, Splenomegaly
		- **Subacute** (3-6 months of disease)
			- 
		- **Chronic** (6 months and more of infection)
			- Arthralgia (usually big joints)
				- Initially migrating pains
			- Swelling of joints
- **Diagnosis**
	- Wright-Heddelson analysis
		- Heddelson - sensitive, for early detection
		- Wright's test - more specific (can define titre)
	- Rose Bengal - a rapid agglutination assay
	- ELISA - for detection antibodies
	- **Confirmatory test**
		- Blood culture (Бакпосев)
		- 
- **Laboratory**
	- Damage to bone marrow leads:
		- Anemia
		- Neutropenia
	- ESR acceleration
	- Rarely mild ↑ of liver enzymes
- **Treatment** 
	- Minimum should be treated 45-60 days by antibiotics, because bacteria is inside of macrophages.
	- Doxycycline
	- Ciprofloxacin
	- In case of *Desensitization* (Десенсибилизация) used Antihistamines - which is allergic reaction to when re-infected by brucellosis (e.g. endogenic or exogenic).
	- Roncoleukin - immunomodulator drug used after antibiotic therapy.

## Histopathology of brucellosis
*Brucellosis is similar to tuberculosis, because of sluggish course of disease.*
Infiltration in case of brucellosis causes densening of the tissue. While in case Tuberculosis infiltration leads to decomposition.
