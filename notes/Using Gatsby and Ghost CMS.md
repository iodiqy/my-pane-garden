Ghost can be used as headless CMS along with Gatsby.
>Headless CMS means back-end separated from presentation layer, where Gatsby will be responsible for.

# Why Gatsby & Ghost
- Ghost is pretty simple CMS (Content Management System)
- Ghost is admin and you use Ghost API to talk to Gatsby Frontend.

# Installing Ghost

```bash
#install the cli
npm install ghost-cli -g
```
If you need to downgrade [[Nodejs]]
```bash
#install ghost
ghost install local
```
