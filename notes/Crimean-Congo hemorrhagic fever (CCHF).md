# Overview

> [!tip] Very dangerous

- Mechanism of transmission
	- Transmissive
	- Blood-borne
	- Contact
- Incubation period
	- 2-14 days
- Periods
	- Disease begins from fever (recognized as flu)
		- Hyperemia
	- Temp lowered 
	- Hemorrhagic symptoms (???? 5-6 days)
	- Reconvalescence period 
		- Can't work for years
		- Very hard to recover
- Lab
	- Leukopenia (it's mostly against)
	- Lymphocytosis (needed for viruses)
	- Anemia (hemorrhage)
	- ESR (inflammation, due to inflammatory proteins, they precipitate on erythrocytes, polyorganic diseases increased esr (rheumatologic), neoplasms increase esr (because of appearance of pathological proteins, pregnancy - also pathological proteins))
- Diagnosis
	- PCR and ELISA serology (ИФА)
- Reservoir (no symptoms in comparison with source of infection)
	- Ticks
- Source of infection
	- Animals, dormant animals
- Natural foci of disease (Природные очаги)
	- Dangerous regions (south of kazakhstan)
- All thrombocytes try to repair endothelium → thrombocytopenia → thrombus formation → hypoxia → brain says lyse those thrombus → release of hypocoagulation → hemorrhagic syndrome
- Intoxication
	- High temperature
	- Myalgia (hypoxia and microcirculation violation)
- Treatment
	- Antiviral (ASAP)
		- Ribovirin
		- Immunoglobulins
	- Thrombo-mass, erythro-mass
- Quarantine
	- CDC three signs for CCHF diagnosis
		- Fever
		- Hemorrhagic syndrome
		- Thrombocytopenia
- Confirmation of diagnosis
	- Tick bite
	- Myalgia
	- Симптом жгута
